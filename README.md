# POS-system
To develop a database management system for a point of sale (POS) system implementing ETL techniques.

As part of a course project, I applied ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) techniques to convert data from CSV files. This involved incorporating advanced relational database concepts such as schemas, views, materialized views, stored procedures, triggers, and transactions on AWS EC2 instances. As a result, the POS system's performance noticeably improved. Additionally, I utilized clustering and NoSQL databases like MongoDB to enhance scalability and execute queries more quickly. This experience significantly increased my understanding of AWS, MariaDB, MongoDB, and ETL concepts.

Highlighted Technologies:

AWS EC2 Instances: Utilized for hosting and managing the system.

MariaDB: Employed for implementing advanced relational database techniques.

MongoDB: Utilized for leveraging NoSQL capabilities and enhancing scalability.

ETL: Demonstrated expertise in Extract-Transform-Load techniques.

POS System: Point of Sale system optimization for improved performance.
